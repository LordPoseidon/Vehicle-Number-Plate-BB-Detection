# Vehicle Number Plate Bounding Box Detection
This Repository contains the code I used to tackle the problem of detecting points of bounding box for number plate of a vehicle.

## Usage

Run [train.py](https://github.com/piyush2896/Vehicle-Number-Plate-BB-Detection/blob/master/train.py) to train a model which will be saved 
to model sub-folder.

Run [predictor.py](https://github.com/piyush2896/Vehicle-Number-Plate-BB-Detection/blob/master/predictor.py) to see the result of the model.

## Dependencies
1. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
2. NumPy
3. OpenCV
4. Matplotlib
5. Pandas
